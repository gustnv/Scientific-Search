# CFFs as SAT: Representation & Solving with SAT Solvers

## ðŸ“š About
Cover-free families (CFFs) are interesting combinatorial objects used in coding theory, cryptography, and group testing. They represent collections of subsets where no subset is entirely covered by the union of others. We can translate this concept into a Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).  By solving this SAT problem with specialized algorithms (SAT solvers), we can effectively find valid CFFs, making SAT solvers a powerful tool for tackling problems related to cover-free families.
